## "Temporal changes in species composition affect a ubiquitous species' views of patch quality"

This repo contains analyses for my project on how _C. penicillatus's_ perception of patch quality has changed through time in response to the colonization of _c. baileyi_ at The Protal Project.

The manuscript for this project is currently under review at Ecology.
